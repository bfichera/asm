Abstract

Main intro

introduction to the AM

equivalence of AM to q->0 potts model

An example (forest fires? magnets?)

Defects in the AM model

My variant
temperature in some way
evolution from finite temperature model to 0 temperature model
evolution from threshold to nonthreshold model

simulations and results

conclusions


Examples

0. There are lots of systems which exhibit criticality without tuning parameters
1. there are many reasons you might think SOC provides a good description of those phenomena
2. threshold behavior, low driving rate, globally stationary regime, power distributions of event sizes and scale invariance
3. earthquakes, droplets on a window, magnetic flux vortices, something biological
