We consider two-point boundary correlations in detail, and discuss a number of complications that arise in the mapping from sandpile correlations to spanning tree correlations; the structure of our results suggests a conjecture that could greatly simplify future calculations. We find a number of three-point functions along closed boundaries, and propose closed boundary field identifications for the height variables. We analyze the effects of dissipative defect sites, at which the number of grains is not conserved, and show that dissipative defects along closed boundaries, and in the bulk, have no effect on any weakly allowed cluster variables, or on their correlations. Along open boundaries, we find a particularly simple field structure; we calculate all \$n\$-point correlations, for any combinations of height variables and dissipative defect sites, and find that all heights and defects are represented by the same field operator.},

@article{turcotte_self-organized_nodate,
	title = {Self-organized criticality},
	abstract = {The concept of self-organized criticality was introduced to explain the behaviour of the sandpile model. In this model, particles are randomly dropped onto a square grid of boxes. When a box accumulates four particles they are redistributed to the four adjacent boxes or lost off the edge of the grid. Redistributions can lead to further instabilities with the possibility of more particles being lost from the grid, contributing to the size of each ‘avalanche’. These model ‘avalanches’ satisﬁed a power-law frequency–area distribution with a slope near unity. Other cellular-automata models, including the slider-block and forest-ﬁre models, are also said to exhibit self-organized critical behaviour. It has been argued that earthquakes, landslides, forest ﬁres, and species extinctions are examples of self-organized criticality in nature. In addition, wars and stock market crashes have been associated with this behaviour. The forest-ﬁre model is particularly interesting in terms of its relation to the critical-point behaviour of the sitepercolation model. In the basic forest-ﬁre model, trees are randomly planted on a grid of points. Periodically in time, sparks are randomly dropped on the grid. If a spark drops on a tree, that tree and adjacent trees burn in a model ﬁre. The ﬁres are the ‘avalanches’ and they are found to satisfy power-law frequency–area distributions with slopes near unity. This forest-ﬁre model is closely related to the site-percolation model, that exhibits critical behaviour. In the forest-ﬁre model there is an inverse cascade of trees from small clusters to large clusters, trees are lost primarily from model ﬁres that destroy the largest clusters. This quasi steady-state cascade gives a power-law frequency–area distribution for both clusters of trees and smaller ﬁres. The site-percolation model is equivalent to the forest-ﬁre model without ﬁres. In this case there is a transient cascade of trees from small to large clusters and a power-law distribution is found only at a critical density of trees.},

More precisely, SOC is shown to result from the tuning of the order parameter to a vanishingly small, but positive value, thus ensuring that the corresponding control parameter lies exactly at its critical value for the underlying transition. This clari es the role and nature of the very slow driving rate common to all systems exhibiting SOC. This mechanism is shown to apply to models of sandpiles, earthquakes, depinning, fractal growth and forest- res, which have been proposed as examples of SOC.},
